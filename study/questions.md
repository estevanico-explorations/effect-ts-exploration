## `Effect` Questions

### General & Tooling
- Is there tree shaking?
  - i.e. Can I make my bundles smaller by importing only bits?
- Which testing library do people prefer?

### `Effect` bits & pieces
- Can someone explain [`Fibers`](https://effect.website/docs/other/glossary#fiber) better and how to use them or use cases? Examples preferred.
- Is there an IO module? i.e. File Reading
- Anything for `rx`?
- Package interop worries
