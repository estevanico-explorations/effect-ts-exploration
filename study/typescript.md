Things I have or plan to learn about `TypeScript`. I know and understand `TypeScript` but I want to know and understand it at a deeper level. This document is a journal of what I have learned. I plan to move this to a different location sometime in the future when I feel I have a greater understanding of using the language as well as it's nuances. It will most likely go into my [computer science](https://github.com/mrpotatoes/computer-science-in-javascript/) repo.
