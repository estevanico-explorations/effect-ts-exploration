# [Effect Framework](https://effect.website/) Exploration
This repo contains my efforts learning the ins-and-outs of the `Effect` library. I will be documenting my experience in the code as well as in documents I write in this repo. All that will be linked in this `README.md` file.

## Exploration Path
- [ ] Create the project and get it installed and running
  - [ ] Decide if making a library or server
- [ ] Get it setup w/`rollup`
- [ ] Code quality tools
- [ ] Setup testing library
## `Effect` Questions
### General & Tooling
- Is there tree shaking?
  - i.e. Can I make my bundles smaller by importing only bits?
- Which testing library do people prefer?
- Are there any boilerplates?
### `Effect` bits & pieces
- Can someone explain [`Fibers`](https://effect.website/docs/other/glossary#fiber) better and how to use them or use cases? Examples preferred.
- Is there an IO module? i.e. File Reading
- Anything for `rx`?
